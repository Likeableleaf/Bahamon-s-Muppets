Game:Bahamón’s Muppets
Team: Valhalla

Controls:
Mouse controls rotation of the player in the desk, and the space bar allows the player to push off the floor moving them backwards.
The goal of the game is to be the last one standing and not “kicked” out of class. The AI student in the playable build will attempt to come close to the player, turn around and then kick them off their desk. The player is able to do the same, by kicking the AI student out of their desk and having them hit by the teacher when they turn around once the timer runs out. The teacher turns around at a random time, and the timer shows up when there is 10 seconds left before the teacher turns. When the teacher turns, for any movement of the player or AI student, the teacher will chuck an eraser and if they are out of their desk and hit they are eliminated. There is currently no end screen, and no way the game can loop outside of pressing ‘R’ for restart.
Cheat Codes: ‘R’ for restarting the game. 'T' is for killing the teacher. 'K' is for killing the students.
